# Queuing-Models
This was for a fourth year module where I had to simulation two queuing models and evaluate both the models. The files in first_exercise contain Python scripts for the logic of a M/M/C/C queuing model. The files customer_class.py and server_class.py create classes so customer and server objects can be created. The file simulate.py creates a simulation class which effectively creates objects where the M/M/C/C queuing model can be executed. Each object will differ by the parameters chosen for the execution. You can then execute main.py to execute the two functions that will produce some results for the server utilisation and blocking probability based on some parameters that were given to me. The files in second_exercise have exactly the same structure. However this file contains Python scripts for the lgoic of a M1+M2/M/C/C queuing model.
